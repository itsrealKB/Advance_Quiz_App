## Technologies Used

- React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- React-router-dom: a popular routing library for React applications that allows developers to define routes and handle navigation between them. It simplifies the                           process of creating client-side routing logic and enables developers to build single-page applications with multiple views and user-friendly                           URLs. The library is built on top of react-router and provides a set of routing components that are easy to use and highly customizable.

- Material Ui: a popular React UI library that provides a set of pre-built components and styling options based on Google's Material Design guidelines. It simplifies                  the process of building user interfaces in React by providing a consistent design system and a wide range of components such as buttons, forms, icons,                  and more. Material-UI's components are highly customizable, allowing developers to easily modify the look and feel of their applications. It also                      provides features such as theming, responsive design, and accessibility, making it a powerful and versatile UI library for building web applications.

- Axios:  a popular Promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript that allows developers to make HTTP requests from their applications. It supports all major browsers and            can be used in both client-side and server-side applications. Axios simplifies the process of making HTTP requests by providing an easy-to-use API and                  handling common tasks such as request cancellation, error handling, and response parsing. It also supports features such as automatic transformation of JSON            data, interceptors for request and response handling, and the ability to cancel requests. Axios has become a popular choice for making HTTP requests in                JavaScript applications due to its ease of use, flexibility, and robust feature set.
